# StepperFX
Implementation of the Stepper algorithm using the JavaFX framework

First large-scale project using JavaFX.
Enables users to take input directly in the app or through a chosen .txt file.  
Users can select an arbitrary number of worker threads to do the operations.  
This program supports both normal and enhanced (version 2) processes.

For Java 21+

## IDE Configuration Instructions
Use the following directory configuration:
- Sources root: `src/main/java`
- Resources root: `src/main/resources`
- Test Sources root: `src/test/java`

To change the directory configuration in IntelliJ, right-click on a directory, then go to "Mark Directory As".  
These settings are known to work for the IntelliJ IDE. I have never used another IDE before.

The main class is `src/main/java/stepperfx/Launcher`. If not exporting to a JAR, `src/main/java/stepperfx/MainApplication` also works as the main class.



## Git Contribution Rules
Make all changes and updates on a *new* Git branch. When the changes are completed and *thoroughly tested*, make a pull request to "main".

Any version branches (i.e. "v0.7.0") should *never* be deleted!  
Do not push to "main" without my explicit permission!



## Project Structure

##### FXML and CSS Stylesheets
FXML files are stored in `src/main/resources/views`.
- Each FXML file represents the layout of one of the app's screens.
- The directory also contains CSS stylesheets: `login-styles.css`, for the login and login rejection screens,
  and `main-styles.css`, for all other screens (and dialogs).

##### Images
Images are stored in `src/main/resources/images`.
- Any image that you don't want pushed to the GitHub
  should be put in another directory inside `src/main/resources/`, then added to your `.gitignore` file.
  As an example, I have images in `src/main/resources/images_gitignored`, a directory added to my `.gitignore`.  
  Note: To use the images, you need to change the paths in the `src/main/java/stepperfx/integration/StyledDialogs` class.

##### Code
Java source code is inside the `src/main/java/stepperfx` package.
- The **main class** is called `MainApplication`. To export the app as a JAR, select `Launcher` as the main class.

- The `controllers` package contains the **GUI controllers**. Each controller class is responsible for one screen.

- The `integration` package holds functionality **shared throughout the app**. It contains 4 classes and 1 enum:
  - `IntegratedController`, the **base class for GUI controllers**. It allows controllers to change the screen and access shared variables.
  - `ScreenManager`, which controllers use to **change the screen**.
  - `ScreenName` (the enum), a set of **possible screen names**.
  - `StepperFields`, containing the **shared state** of the application. The class contains constants, encapsulated variables, and a shared Service for multithreaded operations.
  - `StyledDialogs`, with static methods to **show dialogs**. It takes its styles from the `dialog` style class inside `src/main/resources/views/main-styles.css`.

- The `threading` package contains worker thread classes, which the app uses to **process inputs**.
  - `ProcessService`, where an instance is stored in a `StepperFields` instance, deploys a `ProcessTask`.
  - `ProcessTask` processes the input given to it by a `ProcessService`. To help it process input, a Task assigns work to ProcessSubtask instances.
  - `ProcessSubtaskDiacritics` and `ProcessSubtaskMain` parse a small piece of their given inputs.


## Final Notes

Anyone working on this project must follow the rules stated in [the rules document](rules.md).
I reserve the rights to change, update, nullify, or interpret the rules at any time.  
Failure to obey the rules means I will hunt you down and [DATA EXPUNGED].

DO NOT PUSH TO THE GITHUB "main" BRANCH WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION FROM ME... OR ELSE.
(YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. TRUST ME.)
